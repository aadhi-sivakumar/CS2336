# Network Simulator  

This project is a **discrete event-driven network simulator** built in **Java**. It simulates a star-topology network where all communication passes through a central host. 
The simulation processes two types of events, **Timer** and **Message**, stored in a custom **FutureEventList**. Events are inserted in order and handled sequentially until the simulation completes. The project emphasizes working with abstract classes, inheritance, custom data structures, and time-based event loops.
